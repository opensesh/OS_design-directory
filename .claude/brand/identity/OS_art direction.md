# Open Session Art Direction Guide
*Version 1.0 - AI-Interpretable Brand System*

## Brand Overview

Open Session is a design company operating at the intersection of traditional design excellence and AI-powered creativity. We serve two audiences:
- **Clients**: Through design systems, brand identity, web development, workshops, and public speaking

## AI Implementation Guidelines

### Decision Tree for Territory Selection

**Social Channel Logic**:
- Automotive/Technical Content → **Auto**
- Human/Portrait Content → **Lifestyle**
- Action/Sports Content → **Move**

**Website/Newsletter Logic**:
- Case Study/Experiment → **Work**
- Landscape/Contemplative → **Escape**
- Abstract/Emotional → **Feel**

### Texture Application Logic

1. Assess hero element needs
2. If background texture needed:
   - Cover slides → Apply Halftone or Paper
   - Motion graphics → Apply ASCII (core element)
3. Always maintain exact opacity and blend mode specifications
4. Only apply to Vanilla or Charcoal backgrounds

### World-Building Checklist
- [ ] Does the image create an immersive mood?
- [ ] Is there a clear emotional narrative?
- [ ] Does it reflect isolation OR acceleration?
- [ ] Are visual cues consistent with territory?
- [ ] Will the creative audience see themselves?
