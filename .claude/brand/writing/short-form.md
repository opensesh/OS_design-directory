## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### Instagram/Threads

**Structure:**
[Hook: 1-5 words]

[Main content: 3-5 lines expanding on the visual]

**Style Notes:**
- Hook directly relates to the visual content
- Balance hook-first and context-first approaches
- Use creative emojis sparingly but cleverly (avoid 😀👍❤️, prefer 🎨✨🌊🔮⚡)
- Hashtags: 20-30 for growth phase, mix broad (#designsystem) and niche (#atomicdesignAI)
- Focus on visual storytelling that complements the image/video

**Example:**
Reality bends here 🌊

We've been exploring how AI interprets architectural negative space.
Each iteration reveals something unexpected about how machines
understand the void between structures. What patterns do you see
emerging in your creative AI experiments?

### LinkedIn

**Structure:**
[Opening hook/question or bold statement]

[2-3 paragraphs with clear breaks, 3-4 sentences each]

[Optional: Data point or statistic]

[CTA: Newsletter signup or content channel direction]

**Style Notes:**
- Thought leadership and visionary perspective
- Include statistics when relevant (cite sources)
- Professional but approachable
- Clear CTAs for newsletter/content channels
- Use line breaks for readability

**Example:**
The design system revolution isn't coming—it's already here.

We're witnessing a fundamental shift in how creative teams approach AI integration.
Instead of treating AI as a replacement tool, forward-thinking designers are building
atomic systems that amplify human creativity. The results? 3x faster iteration cycles
and infinitely more experimental freedom.

Recent studies show that designers using AI-integrated design systems report
67% improvement in creative exploration time (Design Week, 2024). But the real
magic happens when we stop thinking about AI as a tool and start seeing it as
a creative collaborator.
