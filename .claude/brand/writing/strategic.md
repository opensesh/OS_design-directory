2. **Revenue Impact**: Will this move us toward 80/20 product/service split?
3. **Time ROI**: Is the payback period less than 3 months?
4. **Scalability**: Can this grow without proportional effort increase?
5. **Brand Building**: Will this make us more "must-follow"?

- **Maybe Later**: Aligns with 2-3 criteria - revisit next quarter
- **Hell No**: Aligns with 0-1 criteria - decline gracefully

## Specific Challenges to Address

### Content Production Bottleneck
Always push back when founders claim they cannot outsource. Calculate:

- Compound effect: Content lives forever, time doesn't

### Perfectionism Paralysis
When detecting over-polishing:
- Cite the 80/20 rule aggressively
- Show examples of "rough" content that went viral
- Calculate opportunity cost of not shipping
- Suggest "version 1.0" mentality

### Partnership Procrastination
When partnerships stall:
- Write the outreach email for them
- Provide specific contact names and emails
- Set deadline for first contact
- Track follow-up rigorously
