# OPEN SESSION Blog Writing Style Guide

## Quick Reference

**Tone**: Conversational-professional balance
**Reading Level**: High school (accessible to all)
**Pronouns**: Always "we" (never "I")
**Default Platform**: Ask if not specified

## Platform Strategy

### Substack (2-5 min reads)
- **Purpose**: Real-time experiments, fresh discoveries
- **Style**: Quick updates, learning-in-public
- **Content**: "Just tried Claude 4.5 today, here's what happened"
- **Structure**: Hook → Quick experiment → Insight → CTA
- **Best for**: AI tools launches, design system experiments, workflow tests

### Medium (4-10 min reads)
- **Purpose**: Thought leadership, frameworks, industry analysis
- **Style**: Authoritative but accessible
- **Content**: "How MCP Will Transform Design Systems (With Examples)"
- **Structure**: Problem → Framework → Case studies → Future implications → CTA
- **Optimize for**: Medium algorithm, claps, engagement

### Personal Blog (4-10 min reads)
- **Purpose**: SEO-optimized version of Medium content
- **Additions**: More keywords, internal links, meta descriptions
- **Note**: Content mirrors Medium but with SEO enhancements

## Writing Formula

### Opening
1. Start with a hook or problem statement
2. Follow with a story (personal experience, client problem, industry challenge)
3. Keep it relatable to designers feeling left behind by AI's pace

### Body Structure
- **Headings**: Clear, crisp, simple (use multiple subheadings)
- **Paragraphs**:
  - Short for familiar concepts (ChatGPT, Figma)
  - Longer for new concepts (MCP, API architecture)
- **Technical Details**: Include to establish authority, but explain simply
- **Balance**: Mix inspiration (future vision) with instruction (how-to)

### Conclusion
Always include:
- Summary or key takeaways
- CTA to website/newsletter
- Optional: Questions for engagement

## Voice Guidelines

## Example Opening (Substack)

```
Yesterday, Anthropic dropped MCP.

We immediately canceled our meetings and spent 6 hours building with it.

Here's what every designer needs to know: MCP isn't just another tool—it's the
bridge between your Figma files and production code that we've been waiting for.
```

## Example Opening (Medium/Blog)

```
The Problem with Modern Design Systems

Last week, a creative director at a $10M startup told us something we hear
constantly: "My team spends 60% of their time on updates, not innovation."

We've been there. At Google, we watched teams struggle with the same challenge.
But here's what changed everything: treating design systems as living,
AI-powered organisms rather than static libraries.
```

## Questions to Ask Before Writing

1. "Which platform is this for?"
2. "Should I include code examples?"
3. "Do you have a relevant client story or personal anecdote?"
4. "Want me to suggest image placement?"
5. "Is this based on a recent experiment or broader analysis?"
