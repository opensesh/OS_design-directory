# OPEN SESSION Writing Style Guide

## Brand Voice & Identity

### Core Personality
We are **relatable, cool, creative, and intelligent** facilitators. We balance conversational warmth with professional authority – knowledgeable enough to lead, approachable enough to invite collaboration. We sound like trusted creative partners who know what we're talking about but invite people into the conversation.

### Voice Principles
- **We not I**: Always use "we" unless specifically instructed otherwise
- **Inclusive & Warm**: Everyone should feel welcome in our creative community
- **Authority with Approachability**: Start with credibility, deliver with humanity
- **Simply Complex**: If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it

### Language Level
Content should be understandable by anyone with a high school education, but scalable to expert audiences. We avoid unnecessary jargon while not dumbing down concepts. Technical terms are fine when explained clearly.

## Content Structure Framework

### YouTube Script Format (Not Word-for-Word)

Scripts should be outline-based with key phrases, chapters, and timestamps. Videos are recorded freestyle with structure guidance.

#### Standard Video Structure

**HOOK (5 seconds)**
- Single compelling visual or statement
- Energy: HIGH
- Immediately show what they'll learn or see

**CHAPTER 1: Context/Problem (1-2 minutes)**
- Set up the challenge designers face
- Establish our credibility naturally
- Energy: MODERATE-HIGH
- Visual cues: Screen recording or B-roll

**CHAPTER 2: Core Value/Solution (3-5 minutes)**
- Main teaching content
- Step-by-step when applicable
- Energy: FOCUSED
- Demo markers for screen recordings

**CHAPTER 3: Technical Deep Dive (2-3 minutes)**
- For advanced viewers
- Explain the "how it really works"
- Energy: CALM-TECHNICAL
- Optional based on content type

**CONCLUSION: Next Steps (30 seconds)**
- Newsletter CTA (soft sell)
- What to explore next
- Energy: INSPIRING

### Content Length Guidelines

- **Quick Tips/Shorts**: 30-60 seconds
- **Tutorial Videos**: 5-15 minutes
- **Thought Leadership**: 5-10 minutes
- **YouTube Sweet Spot**: 6-12 minutes
- **Future Course Modules**: 10-30+ minutes

## Hook Formulas

### Primary Hook Structure (Kallaway's 3-Step)

1. **Context Lean-In**: Start with familiar pain point
2. **Scroll Stop Interjection**: Interrupt with unexpected angle
3. **Contrarian Snapback**: Deliver the surprising solution

### Hook Examples for Design Content

- "Every designer knows [familiar pain]... but what if I told you [unexpected solution]"
- "You're probably using [common tool] wrong... here's the [specific technique] way"
- "I spent [time] at [Google/SAP] learning this one workflow that changed everything"
- "This AI technique just eliminated 3 hours of iteration"
- "Your design system is overengineered... let me show you atomic simplicity"

## Platform-Specific Adaptations

### YouTube (Primary Platform)
- Visual-first storytelling
- Screen recordings with picture-in-picture
- Clear chapter markers
- Newsletter CTA in description + soft mention in video
- Optimize for both learning and entertainment

### LinkedIn
- Thought leadership and visionary content

## Teaching Philosophy

### Information Architecture

1. **Analogy First**: "Think of design tokens like LEGO blocks..."
2. **Practical Demo**: Show it working in real context
3. **Technical Depth**: Explain underlying mechanics for those interested
4. **Real Application**: Connect to actual project use

### Complexity Layering

Start simple, add layers:
- Beginners get the concept
- Intermediates get the workflow
- Experts get the technical details
- Everyone leaves with value

## Script Markers & Energy Levels

### Energy Indicators

## Call-to-Action Strategy

### Primary CTA: Newsletter
Focus exclusively on newsletter signup for now. Position as free resource library, not email list.

### Soft CTA Examples
- "I'm dropping the Figma file for this in our newsletter"
- "We break this down step-by-step in our free resources"
- "Join thousands of designers getting our weekly workflows"
- "The template link is in the description"

### Never Use
- Urgency or scarcity tactics
- Hard selling
- "Limited time" language
- Pressure techniques

## Engagement Approach

### Natural Engagement Prompts
- "What workflows are you struggling with?"
- "Have you tried this technique?"
- "Drop your biggest design challenge below"
- Ask thought-provoking questions about industry trends

### Community Building
- Respond to comments genuinely
- Feature community work when relevant
- Create participatory content opportunities
- Build scalable trust through consistency

## Content Formulas

### Thought Leadership Formula
1. Industry observation or trend
2. Our unique perspective (leverage enterprise experience)
3. What this means for designers
4. Practical application
5. Soft newsletter CTA

### Tutorial/Workflow Formula
1. Show end result first (visual hook)
2. Explain why current methods fall short
3. Step-by-step solution
4. Pro tips and variations
5. Link to resources

### Quick Tips Formula
1. Pattern interrupt visual
2. Single actionable insight
3. Quick demonstration
4. "Follow for more AI design workflows"

## Writing Style Rules

### Must Include
- Visual-first approach
- 5-second compelling hook
- Clear value proposition
- Energy and pacing markers
- Newsletter value mention

### Always Avoid
- Politics or geopolitical issues
- Being prescriptive without options
- Overly technical without explanation
- Hard selling or pressure
- "Expert" or "guru" positioning

### Tone Guidelines
- **Openings**: Establish credibility naturally
- **Teaching**: Conversational and clear
- **Technical**: Precise but accessible
- **Conclusions**: Inspiring and actionable

## Credibility Integration

### Natural Authority Building
- "When we were building systems at Google..."
- "This workflow saved our enterprise clients hours..."
- "After a decade in UX at places like SAP..."
- Never force credentials, weave them naturally

### Experience References
- Mention past work only when directly relevant
- Focus on what viewers will achieve, not our achievements
- Use experience to validate techniques, not to boast

## Evolution Strategy

### Monthly Review Questions
1. What's the current free/paid content ratio?
2. Which hooks performed best?
3. Are we maintaining 80/20 rule (core expertise vs personal)?
4. Time to introduce course content?
5. Which workflows resonated most?

### Content Evolution Path
1. **Phase 1**: Volume and experimentation
2. **Phase 2**: Focus on top performers
3. **Phase 3**: Systematic workflow libraries
4. **Phase 4**: Course content introduction
5. **Phase 5**: Community-generated content
